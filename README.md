# SROCC_PLCC_calculate
Matlab code for calculates the SROCC and PLCC metrics (code for image quality assessment).

# How to use?
1. Put your predicted image quality scores and gound truth scores to the txt file.
2. run `calculate.mat`

# Notes
The calculation of SROCC and KROCC does not require nonlinear mapping. The nonlinear fitting is required before the calculation of PLCC.
